Publications
============

We're currently working on a paper to be submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science (TPS).

Until then, you can cite our :download:`poster <../../publications/poster/Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation for design of Pareto-optimal current drive profiles in STEP - poster.pdf>` from the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Fusion Engineering (SOFE):

    Brown, T., Marsden, S., Casson, F., Terenin, A., and Gopakumar, V., "Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation for design of Pareto-optimal current drive profiles in STEP", presented at 30th IEEE Symposium on Fusion Engineering, Oxford, UK, 12th July 2023.
